Problem:
I am using anki to practice flashcards for my language learning. I often read books and need to lookup new words (or those I have forgotten) and then create anki-cards out of them.
Currently I am doing this manually, but I want to automate the process. My goal is to have some application on my phone whith which I can take a photo and then get the text as a selectable list of buttons which I can click. Then a translation is created for this word. If I like it I can then proceed to create a new anki card out of it. This card should be in the same style and card type as my other cards from the deck.
One important thing to notice is that my anki app runs on my Mac while I want to use my phone for the process described above. The existing cards from anki and the newly created cards thus need to be synced.
I do not want to install the anki app on my phone.

Acceptence criteria:
- language for translation is derived from selected deck and selected word
- application flow (general, details added later)
	- user makes photo
	- words are extracted from text in photo
	- user selects word
	- word is translated to the language of the configured target anki deck
	- user can now view translation. If content, can create card via button
	- card proposal is created in the same style as the existing cards (card-template, formatting of the card content, normalization, etc.)
	- user can view proposal and accept or reject it
	- some translations are not to the native tongue of the user. Thus it might occur, that the user does not know the resulting translation. In that case the user can request an additional translation to the native tongue of the user (configured in application by the user) that is added to the already existing translation (not replacing it). The style and formatting of such additional translations is to be derived from the existing cards
- configuration by user:
	- decks can be selected by the user
	- any language translation pairs are possible
	- native tongue of user
- duplicate detection
	- duplicates should be detected and the user should be asked whether he wants to proceed/abort/modify existing card
	- duplicates should be detected in a semantic way ('to have' should be recognized as a duplicate of 'have something')
- syncing
	- the created cards need to be synced with the deck. This does not have to be done immediately after card creation. But when opening anki on my mac to practice, I need to be able to somehow sync with the new cards and also sync cards manually created in anki back to the card creation mechanism
- security
	- only I should be able to use the application for now (no one else!)
	- in general it needs to meet common security requirements of publicly exposed applications
- feature preview (features that should not be added now but will be later. Should be considered when evaluating architecture)
	- generate audio for new word to practice pronounciation (also added to the anki card)
	- adding other users to the application
